I wanted to see what I would come up with building a robot on the cheap. I've been surprised at how 
much I've learned from this project. I've really enjoyed building parts and after critical review 
re-designing them. This repo contains SketchUp drawings and Arduino Sketches I designed. I've 
approached this projects in steps and plan to add to it in a modular fashion, building the robot, 
control movement, add sensors and algorythms.

I have a YouTube video of this project at http://youtu.be/pzRvD9gosbk
